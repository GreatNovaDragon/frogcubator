## Running the game

You can run (and build) the game using Godot 4.3 (Mono version).

There are fallback controlls with mouse/keyboard and gamepad, no need to build the contoller (unless you want to).

Using mouse/keyboard press **space** to pump.

Using gamepad use  **right trigger** to pump.

## Build the controller

If you want to build the controller look into [frog_controller_rpm](https://github.com/GreatNovaDragon/frogcubator/tree/main/frog_controller_rpm) for more details.
